# RNGQuest

An endless Android game about fighting enemies, and letting randomness decide how things should go.

Still in early development.

Features so far:
* Game loop and rendering system
* Main menu, info, and character selection screens
* Buttons!
* Scaling support for different Android devices
* Soundtrack (somewhat)
* Graphics (somewhat)
* Combat system
* A small amount of enemies
* Inventory + Items + Shop system

Still need to add:
* Different spells for different classes
* More consumable items
* More enemies
* Different backgrounds + animated backgrounds in combat
* Balancing
* Bosses...?
* Sound effects
* Complete info screen (haha)
